# MicroCaptive
Visualizing Captive Insurance

Python script assumes Scenario One is an object (client).

Getting the Total Investment returns for the first ten years in dataframe form, with $1MM invested each year, is done by:

scenario_one(1000000).total_returns()

Calculating distributions is a goal-seek exercise in Excel.
